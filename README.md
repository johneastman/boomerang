# Custom Interpreter in Python
This is a custom interpreter I am making in Python. Originally, I was following Thorsten Ball's [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/), but I decided to go my own way.

# Install
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * May need to run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install graphviz:
    * Mac: `brew install graphviz`

# Boomerang
Boomerang is a programming language written in Python.

Boomerang is:
* **Interpreted:** code executes in the runtime of another language (in this case, Python).
* **Procedural:** commands are executed in the order they are defined.
* **Dynamically Typed:** variable, function, parameter, etc. types are not declared explicitly; rather, they are interpreted from the values they are assigned (e.g., `1` is an integer, `3.14159` is a float, `"hello world!"` is a string, etc.).
* **Strongly Typed:** strict rules for how different types interact (e.g. `1 + 1` or `1 + 1.5` are valid, but `1 + "hello world!"` is invalid).

# Install
1. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * May need to run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/)
4. Optional: this project uses lefthook for pre-commit verification. Follow the installation and setup process [here](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/blob/master/docs/full_guide.md)

# Running
Boomerang files end with the `.bng` extension (e.g., `main.bng`).

To run a Boomerang file:
`python3 main.py --path [PATH TO FILE]`

To run the repl:
`python3 main.py --repl`

**NOTE:** `python3` may not be how python files are run on your machine.

## Flask App
Boomerang has a web interface that will allow you to run it from the browser!

To run the Flask app, run `flask --app flask_app run`.

### Deploying to Pythonanywhere
1. Make sure you have signed up for a free PythonAnywhere account, and youâ€™re logged in. 
2. Go to the Web menu item and then press the Add new web app button. 
3. Click Next, then click on Flask and click on the latest version of Python that you see there. Then click Next again to accept the project path.
4. In the Code section of the Web menu page click on Go to Directory next to Source Code.
5. Click "Open Bash console here" at top of page.
6. Replaced the content of `mysite` with this repo: `git clone https://github.com/johneastman/boomerang.git mysite`
    * You may need to delete (`rm -rf mysite`) or rename (`cp -r mysite/ mysite2/`) existing `mysite` directory.
7. Back on the web app configuration page, I clicked `Reload jeastman.pythonanywhere.com`

# Development Guide
The following information is for contributing to this project.

## Exceptions
There are two types of exceptions: [Language Exceptions](#language-exceptions) and [Program Exceptions](#program-exceptions).

### Language Exceptions
These are errors introduced by users into Boomerang code (syntax errors, index out of range, invalid token, etc). The interpreter will catch these errors and display them to the user.

To raise a language exception, call the `raise_error` method in `utils.py`, which raises a `LanguageRuntimeException` exception.

### Program Exceptions
These are errors with the Python code itself and exist to aid the development process. To raise a program exception, raise any valid Python exception (e.g., `raise ValueError`, `raise Exception`, `raise RuntimeError`, etc.).

# Language Specs

## Line Endings
All expressions end with a semicolon `;`.
